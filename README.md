# Scenario
As a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women,I have to analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices and apply these insights to one of the bellabeat products.Bellabeat products became available through a growing number of online retailers in addition to their own e-commerce channel on their website. The company has invested in traditional advertising media, such as radio, out-of-home billboards, print, and television, but focuses on digital marketing extensively. Bellabeat invests year-round in Google Search, maintaining active Facebook and Instagram pages, and consistently engages consumers on Twitter. Additionally, Bellabeat runs video ads on Youtube and display ads on the Google Display Network to support campaigns around key marketing dates.

Sršen knows that an analysis of Bellabeat’s available consumer data would reveal more opportunities for growth. She has asked the marketing analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices. Then, using this information, she would like high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.

## Business Task 
* 1.What are some trends in smart device usage?
* 2.How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
* 3.How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

## Stakeholders
* Urška Sršen: Bellabeat’s cofounder and Chief Creative Officer
* Sando Mur: Mathematician and Bellabeat’s cofounder; key member of the Bellabeat executive team
* Bellabeat marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts

## Source of Data 
FitBit Fitness Tracker Data[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit] (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius): This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.

The data is authentic but the data contains outdated information also from a small sample. Physical activity data was available for all customers but the sleep, weight and heart rate data was poorly recorded hence the sample size is not representative of the whole customer base. The data is publicly available so there is no issue of confidentiality. 

## Preparation,data cleaning process
The data is downloaded and cleaned using SQL queries. The cleaned results are saved as tables and analyzed, visualized in tableau. 

## Analysis 
* It was found from the analysis that the customers mostly used the 'activity' feature of the heath app while 'weight' was the least popular feature. 
* The customers recorded their health activity the most during the weekend. 
* The peak activity hour was 9-10am in the morning and 4-6pm in the afternoon. 
* A strong positive relationship was observed between total steps taken and calories burned/Active minutes. 
* Also more active people recorded better BMI's compared to people with high sedentary lifestyle.
* Customers who took more steps on average were able to sleep quickly after getting on bed while less active customers were found to be sleeping for too long and taking too long to sleep. 

## Share 
The share stage of this project consist of data visualizations. The tableau dashboard is used for the representation of the analysis. [https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/amna.amer/viz/bella_16782057060540/Dashboard1#1]

## Act
Following recommendations are provided for Bellabeat:
* A smart watch or device should be updated to efficiently record heart rates and sleep activity to the app as this is major flaw in other company devices. 
* App should be upgraded to notifiy if the sedantary or sleep minutes reach a limit. 
* App can notify customers to record their weight specifically on weekends or during morning and late afternoon when consumers use the app most. 
* App can advertise getting quality sleep and healthy heart rate, BMI by doing daily walk/exercise and monitor progress through app. 
* Do collaboration with health magazines and market products offering discounts 
* Advertise in health clinics specifically in mental health, heart health, nutrirtionists clinics where customers specifically go for their health concerns.
